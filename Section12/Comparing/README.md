# Section 12

## Lesson 171. Comparable vs. Comparator

Learn the differences between Comparable and Comparator and how to implement them.
I tweaked this code to use an inner class for the Comparator.

## Build & Run

All commands are ran from the root of this directory:

### (Re)Build

```javac -d build src/learn/s12/Main.java```

### Run (Test)

```java -cp build learn.s12.Main```

Combine both commands:

```javac -d build src/learn/s12/Main.java && java -classpath build learn.s12.Main```
